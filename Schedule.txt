Schedule for Matthew Rose PhD thesis: by September 2012

Matthew Rose & Dr Veronique Boisvert January 24th 2012

•	By March 1st: Have everything completed for the SMT efficiency
o	All 2011 SF with full uncertainties (all variables)
o	ATLAS Note complete and submitted
o	Evaluate impact of uncertainties on the cross section analysis
•	By May 1st: Complete characterization of the SMT performance (finish study started first year)
o	In signal MC: study the efficiency: where is the loss of efficiency coming from?
o	In signal MC and QCD MC: where are the fakes coming from: fraction which is decays in flight, hadron punchthrough, others
o	Study overlap with a lifetime tagger in signal MC and QCD MC, for both efficiency and fake aspects

Main Chapters:
1.	Introduction
2.	The LHC and the ATLAS detector
3.	Top physics and cross section
4.	Physics of b-jet identification and the Soft Muon Tagger
5.	Characterization of the SMT tagger using MC simulation
6.	Data determination of the SMT efficiency
7.	Conclusion


Thesis writing schedule:
•	By March 1st: Intro + Detector chapter
•	By April 1st: Theory chapter
•	By May 1st: Description of SMT tagger chapter
•	By June 1st: Tag & Probe study and results
•	By July 1st: Characterization of the SMT performance in MC chapter + Conclusion
