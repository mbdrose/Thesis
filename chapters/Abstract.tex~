A micron-scale laser-wire system was constructed and tested at the
Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) extraction line at the High Energy
Accelerator Research Organisation (KEK) in Japan. The system was
evaluated through collision tests, electron beam tests, laser beam
measurements and simulations. Beam halo measurements were carried out
in order to compare the beam halo to a theory of its production
through gas scattering and towards evaluating it as a source of
background for diagnostic instruments at ATF2 and the International
Linear Collider (ILC). Simulations were carried out to test the signal
extraction of the system at the future ATF2 and of a similar system in
the proposed ILC beam delivery system, with implications for sharing the signal extraction region with the polarimeter.
